  As we stumble into October 2025, IEEE VIT is back from vacation mode and ready to debug life (and code)! 🐞💻<br>
  This month, let's turn coffee into code, ideas into memes, and procrastination into innovation. The grind never stops, but at least the weather's cooler! ☕🍁🚀
</div>

<div align="center">
  <br>
  <br>Join us for projects that are cooler than your AC, workshops that are more fun than group assignments, and hackathons where the only bugs you'll love are the plushie ones. Let's make September legendary (or at least meme-worthy)! 😂🌰💡
